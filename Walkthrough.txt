<=== MySQL ===>
Upload the SQL dump to your phpmyadmin (or other manager)

<=== PHP ===>
Update the data in config.php to reflect your MySQL database login info
(Optional) Update "confirmationkey" on line 34 of Generator.php 

Upload the PHP scripts to your web server (or equivalent location)
Note down the urls for each file (except config.php)

(Optional) Remove Generator.php
- This is for if you do not want to allow others to generate licenses (they would have to have the right url and confirmationkey but this is just incase)
-If you do not remove this file you may want to set up extra authentication for it

<=== C# ===>
Update the data in Login.cs on line 27 & 28 to reflect the urls you just saved


<=== Running ===>
You should now be able to run the c# program with no issues

Register using the register tab
Login using the login tab
Redeem a token using the token bot, this will use the same name as what is on the label on the right of the program
You can generate tokens using the admin tab
